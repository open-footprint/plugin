# Open Footprint

## Overview

An open-source platform that monitors the sites you regularly visit, building up a cohesive picture of the information and potential footprint you're placing on the internet.

## Why

In the past 10 years social media has been increasingly in the focus of the media, with new platforms popping up all the time. It’s addictive and on paper very useful but like most things it has a dark side.

This project aims to give the user a birds-eye view of their journey across the internet super-highway, in order to help teach better internet safety.

## Roadmap

### Browser Plugin (Firefox / Google Chrome)

* Installed via the user.
* Add Name / Alias.
* Reads browser activity, facebook / twitter / etc (can choose how much).
* Checks for facebook / twitter widgets on pages and records it (as if you are logged into facebook each facebook widget you visit connects your browser activity to your facebook account).
* Start building a picture of your activity.
* Show activity on dashboard, like Google Analytics with ability to drill-down to specific points.

## Todo

* Need to figure out how to create account locally inside the browser eco-system, via local storage.
* Research libraries available to help build package.
* Brainstorm any concerns, other ways of achieving the end goal.
